# Redirect URI Fix - Final Update

## Issue Fixed
The interactive authentication was failing with a redirect URI mismatch error because there was still one reference to the old redirect URI `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` in the token exchange code.

## What Was Changed
Fixed the last remaining reference to the old redirect URI in `AuthService.ts`:

**File:** `src/auth/AuthService.ts`
**Line:** ~495
**Changed from:**
```typescript
redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/callback',
```

**Changed to:**
```typescript
redirectUri: 'http://localhost',
```

## Complete Fix Summary
All redirect URI references have now been updated to use `http://localhost` which matches the Azure App Registration configuration:

1. ✅ Authorization URL in `acquireTokenInteractively()` - Fixed
2. ✅ Token exchange in `handleAuthRedirect()` - Fixed (this update)
3. ✅ Application built and ready for testing

## Next Steps
1. **Restart the application** (npm start)
2. **Test interactive authentication** by clicking "Interactive Authentication" 
3. **Verify Azure App Registration** is configured as "Mobile and desktop applications" platform
4. **Confirm redirect URI** `http://localhost` is listed in Azure AD

## Expected Behavior
- Interactive authentication should open a browser window
- User can sign in with their Microsoft account
- Browser redirects to `http://localhost` (which is captured by the application)
- Application exchanges the authorization code for tokens
- Authentication completes successfully without redirect URI mismatch errors

## Azure App Registration Requirements
Ensure your Azure App Registration has:
- **Platform:** Mobile and desktop applications
- **Redirect URI:** `http://localhost`
- **Allow public client flows:** Enabled
- **API Permissions:** Appropriate Microsoft Graph permissions

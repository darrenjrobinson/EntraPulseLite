# Test Connection Feature Implementation

## Issue Resolution
The "Test Connection" button was missing from the cloud provider configuration cards in the Enhanced Settings Dialog.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced CloudProviderCardProps Interface
- Added `onTestConnection: (config: CloudLLMProviderConfig) => Promise<boolean>` prop

### 2. CloudProviderCard Component Updates
- Added state management for test connection:
  - `isTestingConnection: boolean` - tracks if test is in progress
  - `connectionStatus: 'idle' | 'success' | 'error'` - tracks test result
- Added `handleTestConnection()` function to manage the test process
- Added "Test Connection" button with dynamic states:
  - Default: "Test Connection"
  - Loading: Shows spinner
  - Success: "Connection OK" (green)
  - Error: "Test Failed" (red)

### 3. EnhancedSettingsDialog Updates
- Added `handleTestConnection()` method that:
  - Creates temporary LLMConfig from CloudLLMProviderConfig
  - Calls `window.electronAPI.llm.testConnection()`
  - Returns boolean success/failure result
- Passed `onTestConnection={handleTestConnection}` to all CloudProviderCard instances

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Test Connection button is disabled when no API key is entered
- Button color changes based on connection status (success=green, error=red)
- Loading spinner during connection test
- Button layout uses `flexWrap="wrap"` to handle multiple buttons gracefully

## How It Works

1. **User enters API key** in any cloud provider card
2. **User clicks "Test Connection"** button
3. **Component creates test config** with current form values
4. **Makes IPC call** to main process via `window.electronAPI.llm.testConnection()`
5. **Main process attempts connection** using the provided configuration
6. **UI updates** based on success/failure:
   - Success: Button turns green, shows "Connection OK"
   - Failure: Button turns red, shows "Test Failed"
   - Loading: Shows spinner during test

## Benefits

- **Immediate Feedback**: Users can validate their API keys before saving
- **Error Prevention**: Helps catch configuration issues early
- **Better UX**: Clear visual feedback on connection status
- **Debugging Aid**: Helps troubleshoot connectivity issues

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Open LLM Settings
2. Enter an API key for any cloud provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini)
3. Click "Test Connection" button
4. Observe the button state changes and feedback

The feature now works for all three cloud providers and provides clear visual feedback about connection status.

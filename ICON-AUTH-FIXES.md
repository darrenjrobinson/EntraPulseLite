## Common Problems & Solutions

### Missing Icons in Header/UI

If icons are missing in the UI:

1. Check that webpack is properly configured with asset loaders
2. Verify that the assets are being copied to the dist folder
3. Make sure the AppIcon component has proper styling based on its context

### Grey Block Behind Logo

This happens when:
1. Background color is set incorrectly
2. Padding is too large and hides parts of the logo
3. The asset isn't properly loaded

Solution: Ensure the AppIcon component has appropriate styling with transparent background.

### Asset Loading Between Development and Production

The app needs different asset paths depending on environment:
- In development: Use relative paths from source
- In production: Use paths from the packaged app resources

Our updated `getAssetPath` function now handles this correctly by using:
- Webpack's asset imports for bundled assets
- IPC bridge for dynamic asset loading

## Testing Asset Loading

Run the asset diagnostics tool to verify your asset setup:
```
npm run asset-diagnostics
```

This will check:
- Asset directories exist
- Assets are properly copied during build
- Webpack configuration is correct

## Adding New Assets

To add a new asset:

1. Place the file in the `assets` directory
2. For frequently used assets, add an import to the `preImportedAssets` object in `assetUtils.ts`
3. Use the `getAssetPath()` function to reference the asset in your components
4. Rebuild the application with `npm run build`

# Authentication Race Condition Fix

## Problem Identified
The interactive authentication was completing successfully but showing "Login failed" in the UI due to a race condition:

1. ✅ User completes authentication successfully  
2. ✅ Browser redirects to `http://localhost` with authorization code
3. ✅ `handleAuthRedirect()` gets called and closes the authentication window
4. ❌ **Race condition**: Window `closed` event fires and rejects the promise with "Authentication window was closed by user"
5. ✅ Token exchange continues and succeeds (but promise already rejected)
6. ❌ UI shows "Login failed" despite successful authentication

## Console Evidence
```
🔑 Authorization code received, exchanging for tokens...
Authentication error: Error: Authentication window was closed by user
Login failed: Error: Authentication window was closed by user
✅ Interactive authentication successful!
```

## Root Cause
The `closed` event listener was rejecting the authentication promise even when the window was closed **intentionally** as part of the successful authentication flow.

## Solution Implemented
Added an `authCompleted` flag to distinguish between:
- **User manually closing window** (should reject) 
- **Window closed by application after successful auth** (should not reject)

### Code Changes

**Before:**
```typescript
// Handle window closed by user
authWindow.on('closed', () => {
  reject(new Error('Authentication window was closed by user'));
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Handle window closed by user
let authCompleted = false;
const handleWindowClosed = () => {
  if (!authCompleted) {
    reject(new Error('Authentication window was closed by user'));
  }
};
authWindow.on('closed', handleWindowClosed);
```

**Updated Method Signature:**
```typescript
private async handleAuthRedirect(
  url: string, 
  authWindow: BrowserWindow, 
  resolve: (value: AuthToken | null) => void, 
  reject: (reason?: any) => void,
  expectedState: string,
  codeVerifier: string,
  setAuthCompleted: () => void  // New parameter
): Promise<void>
```

**Updated Method Calls:**
```typescript
this.handleAuthRedirect(
  navigationUrl, 
  authWindow, 
  resolve, 
  reject, 
  state, 
  codeVerifier, 
  () => { authCompleted = true; }  // Set flag when auth starts processing
);
```

**Updated handleAuthRedirect Logic:**
```typescript
if (url.startsWith('http://localhost')) {
  // Mark authentication as completed to prevent "window closed" error
  setAuthCompleted();
  
  // ... rest of authentication processing
  authWindow.close(); // This won't trigger rejection anymore
}
```

## How the Fix Works

1. **Normal Flow**: `authCompleted` starts as `false`
2. **User manually closes window**: `closed` event fires → `authCompleted` is still `false` → Promise rejected ✅
3. **Successful auth flow**: 
   - Redirect detected → `setAuthCompleted()` called → `authCompleted` becomes `true`
   - Window closed by app → `closed` event fires → `authCompleted` is `true` → No rejection ✅
   - Token exchange proceeds → Promise resolved with tokens ✅

## Expected Result
- ✅ Authentication window opens
- ✅ User signs in successfully  
- ✅ Window closes automatically
- ✅ **UI shows "Authentication successful"** instead of "Login failed"
- ✅ Application proceeds to main chat interface
- ✅ User can make authenticated Microsoft Graph queries

## Files Modified
- `src/auth/AuthService.ts` - Fixed race condition in interactive authentication flow

## Testing Steps
1. Restart the application
2. Click "Sign in with Microsoft" 
3. Complete authentication in browser window
4. Verify UI shows success message and proceeds to chat interface
5. Test making a Microsoft Graph query to confirm authentication state

The authentication should now work end-to-end without false error messages!

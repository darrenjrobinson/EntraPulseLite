# EntitlementManagement Permission HTML Structure Changes

This document explains the changes made to handle different HTML structures for the EntitlementManagement.Read.All permission page on the Microsoft Graph Permissions website.

## Issue Summary

The HTML structure of the EntitlementManagement.Read.All permission page on graphpermissions.merill.net has changed, which was breaking our method and resource extraction. The page now uses a different format for displaying API methods and resource types.

## Changes Made

### Method Extraction Improvements

1. **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Updated the method extraction to handle multiple patterns:
   - Standard table with "Methods" header
   - "Graph Methods" section with newer table structure
   - Direct extraction from href links in tables
   - Generic table pattern for methods
   - Path-based extraction for entitlement management endpoints

2. **Row Processing Enhancement**: Now collecting content from all cells in a table row to form complete method descriptions, rather than assuming the method is always in the first cell.

3. **Parameter Handling**: Added normalization for API paths with parameters to avoid duplicates when paths use different parameter naming styles.

4. **HTTP Method Support**: Added specific pattern matching for all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE).

### Resource Type Extraction Improvements

1. **Multiple Tab Formats**: Added support for both old and new tabbed interface structures:
   - Classic tab group format with tabgroup_2 ID
   - Modern tab structure with data-tab attributes
   - Alternative tab patterns without specific IDs

2. **Direct Content Extraction**: Added a fallback method to extract resource types directly from the HTML content when tab structures aren't found.

3. **Better Property Extraction**: Improved the extraction of properties from resource type tables.

## Testing and Validation

1. Added a unit test that specifically tests the new HTML structure (`test-entitlement-permission.test.ts`)
2. Updated the live test script with enhanced diagnostic output (`test-live-entitlement-permission.js`)
3. Verified successful extraction of:
   - 77 API methods
   - 37 resource types

## Results

The enhanced code now successfully handles both the old and new HTML structures for the EntitlementManagement.Read.All permission page, making the application more robust to future changes in the documentation format.

### API Methods Example

```
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackages
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackages/{accessPackageId}
```

### Resource Types Example

```
accessPackage
accessPackageAssignment
accessPackageAssignmentPolicy
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more permission categories using the same enhanced patterns
2. Add unit tests for other permission types
3. Consider adding a HTML structure versioning detection mechanism to apply the most appropriate extraction strategies

# EntraPulse Lite v1.0.0-beta.1 Release Notes

## üéâ First Beta Release

Welcome to the first beta release of EntraPulse Lite! This release represents a major milestone in bringing natural language Microsoft Graph API querying to the community.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Enhanced Graph Access**: Hybrid authentication mode combining user tokens with application credentials
- **Progressive Authentication**: Request permissions as needed during conversations
- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Local (Ollama, LM Studio) and cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI) models
- **Built-in MCP Servers**: Lokka MCP for Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Docs MCP for documentation
- **Modern Chat Interface**: Copy code blocks, manage conversations, trace visualization
- **Real-time LLM Monitoring**: Dynamic status tracking and availability checking

## üîí Important Security Notice for Windows Users

**You may see a Windows Defender SmartScreen warning when running this beta release.**

This is **expected behavior** because beta releases are unsigned. To install:

1. Download the installer from GitHub Releases
2. When Windows shows "Windows protected your PC":
   - Click **"More info"**
   - Click **"Run anyway"**
3. Proceed with normal installation

**Why this happens:**
- Beta builds are unsigned for faster development iteration
- Windows SmartScreen warns about unsigned executables as a security precaution
- The software is safe - this is just a protection for unsigned applications

## üì¶ Download Options

- **Windows**: `EntraPulse Lite Setup 1.0.0-beta.1.exe` (unsigned, will show SmartScreen warning)
- **macOS**: `EntraPulse Lite-1.0.0-beta.1.dmg` and `EntraPulse Lite-1.0.0-beta.1-mac.zip`

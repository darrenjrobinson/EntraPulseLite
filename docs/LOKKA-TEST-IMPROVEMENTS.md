# External Lokka MCP Server Test Improvements

## Overview

This PR enhances the test coverage for the External Lokka MCP Server implementation, adding comprehensive tests for error handling, fallback mechanisms, and end-to-end scenarios. These improvements will help ensure the stability and reliability of the External Lokka MCP Server when used in production environments.

## Changes

### Added new test files:
1. `src/tests/integration/lokka-mcp-errors.test.ts` - Tests error handling in the External Lokka MCP Server
2. `src/tests/e2e/lokka-mcp-e2e.test.ts` - End-to-end tests for the full flow from LLM to External Lokka to Graph API
3. `src/tests/unit/lokka-mcp-fallback.test.ts` - Unit tests for the fallback mechanisms in the server startup process

### Benefits
- More complete test coverage for the External Lokka MCP Server
- Better validation of error handling and edge cases
- Testing for fallback mechanisms when dependencies aren't installed
- End-to-end tests that simulate the full user flow

## Testing Notes

### Running the new tests
```bash
# Run integration tests for error handling
npm run test:integration -- -t "Lokka MCP Server Error Handling"

# Run end-to-end tests for the full flow
npm run test:e2e -- -t "External Lokka MCP Server End-to-End"

# Run unit tests for fallback mechanisms
npm run test:unit -- -t "External Lokka MCP Server Fallback"
```

### Test environment requirements
- For the integration and E2E tests, tenant credentials need to be properly configured in `.env.local`
- Unit tests use mocks and don't require network connectivity or real credentials

## What's Next
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling tests for Graph API errors
- [ ] Create specific tests for rate limiting and throttling scenarios
- [ ] Add tests for the interaction between the UI and the External Lokka MCP Server

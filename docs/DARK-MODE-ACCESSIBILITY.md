# Dark Mode Accessibility Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to EntraPulse Lite's dark mode, specifically focusing on link color contrast for better readability.

## Problem
In dark mode, the original blue links (`#64b5f6`) had poor contrast against the dark background, making them difficult to read and potentially failing WCAG accessibility standards.

## Solution
Updated the link colors to use `#87ceeb` (sky blue) in dark mode, which provides significantly better contrast while maintaining the blue color scheme.

## Color Changes

### Dark Mode Links
- **Normal state**: `#87ceeb` (sky blue) - Provides better contrast against dark backgrounds
- **Hover state**: `#add8e6` (light blue) - Lighter shade for hover indication
- **Visited state**: `#dda0dd` (plum) - Distinguishable color for visited links

### Light Mode Links (unchanged)
- **Normal state**: `#1976d2` (Material Design blue)
- **Hover state**: `#1565c0` (darker blue)
- **Visited state**: `#7b1fa2` (purple)

## Accessibility Standards
The new color scheme improves WCAG compliance by providing:
- Better contrast ratio for normal text (4.5:1 minimum)
- Clear distinction between normal and visited links
- Consistent color scheme across the application

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`src/renderer/App.tsx`**
   - Updated theme configuration with new color palette
   - Applied colors to MuiLink and MuiTypography components
   - Ensured proper theming for both light and dark modes

2. **`src/renderer/components/ChatComponent.tsx`**
   - Updated blockquote border colors to match the new theme
   - Applied theme-aware coloring using conditional logic with proper sx function syntax

### Color Values Used

| Element | Light Mode | Dark Mode | Reasoning |
|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Links | `#1976d2` | `#87ceeb` | Sky blue provides better contrast in dark mode |
| Link Hover | `#1565c0` | `#add8e6` | Lighter shade for clear hover indication |
| Link Visited | `#7b1fa2` | `#dda0dd` | Purple/plum maintains visited link distinction |
| Blockquotes | `#1976d2` | `#87ceeb` | Consistent with link colors |

## Testing
To test the improvements:
1. Switch between light and dark modes
2. Verify link readability in both modes
3. Check hover and visited states
4. Ensure consistent theming across all components

## Future Considerations
- Consider using CSS custom properties for easier theme management
- Evaluate other UI elements for similar accessibility improvements
- Regular accessibility audits to maintain WCAG compliance

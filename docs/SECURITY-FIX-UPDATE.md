# Security Fix Update: Configuration Exposure Prevention

## Additional Issues Found and Fixed

After the initial security fix, additional configuration exposure issues were discovered:

### Problem
The ConfigService was still loading and exposing sensitive configuration data during startup because:

1. **LLM Status Monitoring**: The `llm:isLocalAvailable` IPC handler was calling `this.configService.getLLMConfig()` during polling
2. **ConfigService Current Context**: The `getCurrentContext()` method was returning stored application config with cloud provider settings
3. **No Authentication Verification**: The ConfigService had no mechanism to verify authentication before exposing sensitive data

### Root Cause
Even though IPC handlers had authentication checks, the ConfigService itself was loading sensitive data internally during initialization and status checks, which were being logged to the console.

### Additional Security Fixes

#### 1. ConfigService Authentication Verification
- Added `isAuthenticationVerified` boolean flag
- Added `setAuthenticationVerified(boolean)` method 
- Modified `setAuthenticationContext()` to only work when authentication is verified
- Updated `getCurrentContext()` to return safe defaults when authentication is not verified

#### 2. Safe Default Configuration
- Modified `getDefaultUserConfig()` to return truly safe defaults
- Removed cloud provider configurations from default config
- Set `preferLocal: true` for security

#### 3. LLM Status Polling Security
- Removed `this.configService.getLLMConfig()` call from `llm:isLocalAvailable` handler
- Now only checks local LLM availability using hardcoded safe default configs
- No longer exposes user configuration during status checks

#### 4. Two-Phase Authentication Flow
- Phase 1: Basic services initialized with safe defaults
- Phase 2: After authentication verification, full configuration with sensitive data is loaded

### Code Changes Made

#### ConfigService.ts
```typescript
// Added security flag
private isAuthenticationVerified: boolean = false;

// Added verification method
setAuthenticationVerified(isAuthenticated: boolean): void

// Modified context retrieval to be security-aware
private getCurrentContext(): UserConfigSchema {
  if (!this.isAuthenticationVerified) {
    return this.getDefaultUserConfig(); // Safe defaults only
  }
  // ... existing logic for authenticated users
}
```

#### main.ts IPC Handlers
```typescript
// Added authentication verification before setting context
this.configService.setAuthenticationVerified(true);
this.configService.setAuthenticationContext('client-credentials');

// Removed sensitive config access from status checks
// llm:isLocalAvailable no longer calls getLLMConfig()
```

### Testing Results Expected

After these fixes:
- âœ… No sensitive data in startup logs
- âœ… Only local LLM availability checks (safe)
- âœ… Configuration loading only after authentication
- âœ… Safe defaults returned before authentication
- âœ… No API keys or endpoints exposed during polling

### Log Output Expected
Before authentication:
```
[ConfigService] ðŸ”’ Authentication not verified - returning safe defaults
ðŸ”’ Access to cloud provider configuration denied - user not authenticated
```

After authentication:
```
[ConfigService] Authentication verified set to: true
[ConfigService] Using application config - Has cloudProviders: true
```

## Security Validation Checklist

- [ ] Application starts without showing API keys in logs
- [ ] LLM status polling doesn't expose configuration
- [ ] ConfigService returns safe defaults before auth
- [ ] Full configuration only loads after authentication
- [ ] No sensitive data in console during startup
- [ ] MCP servers only initialize with credentials post-auth

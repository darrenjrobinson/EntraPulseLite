# Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
After user authentication, the application was experiencing an infinite loop of configuration loading that prevented the UI from properly updating to enable chat functionality. The ConfigService was being called repeatedly with logs showing:

```
[ConfigService] getLLMConfig - Retrieved config: { ... }
[ConfigService] Authentication verified set to: true
[ConfigService] setAuthenticationContext called - Mode: client-credentials
```

This pattern repeated indefinitely, causing UI freezes and preventing the chat interface from becoming available.

## Root Cause Analysis
The infinite loop was caused by multiple event listeners for the `auth:configurationAvailable` event:

1. **Main Process**: Emitted `auth:configurationAvailable` on EVERY config method call after authentication
   - `getLLMConfig()` 
   - `getConfiguredCloudProviders()`
   - `getDefaultCloudProvider()`

2. **Renderer Process**: Both `App.tsx` and `LLMStatusContext.tsx` listened for this event
   - `App.tsx`: Called `loadLLMConfig()` on event (which called `getLLMConfig()`)
   - `LLMStatusContext.tsx`: Called `forceCheck()` on event (which called LLM status methods)

3. **Cascade Effect**: Every event triggered more config calls, which triggered more events, creating an infinite loop

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Event Notification Control in Main Process
- Added `configurationAvailabilityNotified` flag to track if the event was already sent
- Created helper methods:
  - `notifyConfigurationAvailable(source)`: Emits event only once per authentication session
  - `resetConfigurationAvailabilityFlag()`: Resets flag on logout

### 2. Updated Config Handlers
Modified three IPC handlers to use the new notification system:
- `config:getLLMConfig`
- `config:getConfiguredCloudProviders` 
- `config:getDefaultCloudProvider`

### 3. Simplified Event Handling in Renderer
- **Removed** event listener from `LLMStatusContext.tsx` to prevent duplicate handling
- **Kept** event listener only in `App.tsx` for centralized config management
- **Enhanced** App.tsx to force LLM status check through context when config is available

### 4. Restructured App Component
- Split `App.tsx` into `AppContent` (uses LLM status context) and `App` (provides context)
- Enabled proper communication between config loading and LLM status checking
- Added `forceCheck` dependency to ensure proper event handling

## Files Modified

### Main Process
- **src/main/main.ts**
  - Added `configurationAvailabilityNotified` flag
  - Added `notifyConfigurationAvailable()` and `resetConfigurationAvailabilityFlag()` helper methods
  - Updated auth logout handler to reset flag
  - Updated three config IPC handlers to use new notification system

### Renderer Process
- **src/renderer/App.tsx**
  - Restructured into `AppContent` and `App` components
  - Enhanced `auth:configurationAvailable` event handler to force LLM status check
  - Added `forceCheck` dependency to useEffect

- **src/renderer/context/LLMStatusContext.tsx**
  - Removed `auth:configurationAvailable` event listener to prevent duplicate handling
  - Simplified component to focus only on LLM status polling

## Result
âœ… **Application starts cleanly** without infinite loops
âœ… **No excessive config polling** after authentication
âœ… **Event emitted only once** per authentication session
âœ… **Proper UI state synchronization** when user authenticates
âœ… **Security maintained** with no sensitive config exposure before auth

## Test Verification
The application now:
1. Starts without infinite loops
2. Shows basic UI before authentication
3. Emits configuration availability event exactly once after login
4. Properly updates UI state to reflect authenticated status
5. Enables chat functionality when LLM is available

The logs show clean startup:
```
ðŸ”’ Initializing LLM service with basic configuration (no sensitive data)
âœ… Basic services initialized successfully (no sensitive data exposed)
```

No more repeated ConfigService calls, and the UI can properly update after authentication.

# Application Credentials Removal - Complete

## Summary
Successfully removed all support for Application Credentials (client credentials) authentication from EntraPulse Lite. The application now exclusively supports delegated permissions (User Token mode) with three distinct authentication modes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend (UI) Changes
- **File**: `src/renderer/components/EnhancedSettingsDialog.tsx`
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed all Application Credentials toggle and client secret fields
  - Updated UI to clearly distinguish between Basic User Token, Custom User Token, and Enhanced Graph Access modes
  - Added appropriate helper text and warnings for each mode
  - Fixed logic to show when custom Client ID is used vs ignored

### 2. Backend (Main Process) Changes
- **File**: `src/main/main.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed all references to `useApplicationCredentials` and client secret logic
  - Updated `getAuthConfiguration()` method to properly handle the three authentication modes:
    1. **Enhanced Graph Access**: Uses Microsoft Graph PowerShell client ID (`14d82eec-204b-4c2f-b7e8-296a70dab67e`)
    2. **Custom User Token**: Uses user-provided client ID with delegated permissions
    3. **Basic User Token**: Uses Microsoft Graph CLI client ID (`04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46`)
  - Fixed authentication context to always use `'interactive'` (delegated mode)
  - Removed client secret environment variables from MCP server configurations
  - Updated all logging to remove references to application credentials

### 3. Type Definitions
- **File**: `src/types/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `clientSecret` and `useApplicationCredentials` from `EntraConfig` interface
  - Updated `AuthenticationContext` to only support `'interactive'` mode
  - Removed client credentials mode references

### 4. Configuration Service
- **File**: `src/shared/ConfigService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getAuthenticationPreference()` to always return `'delegated'`
  - Updated `updateAuthenticationContext()` to always use delegated mode
  - Removed client secret references from logging

### 5. Test Files
- **Files**: 
  - `src/tests/unit/config-service-dual-auth.test.ts` (deprecated)
  - `src/tests/unit/config-service-dual-auth-fixed.test.ts` (deprecated)
  - `src/tests/unit/mcp-sdk.test.ts` (updated)
- **Changes**:
  - Deprecated tests that referenced Application Credentials
  - Updated remaining tests to remove client secret and application credentials logic

### 6. Documentation
- **Files**: `docs/INSTALLATION.md`, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Clarified that only delegated permissions are supported
  - Removed all references to Application Credentials and client secrets
  - Documented the three authentication modes clearly
  - Updated field requirements and configuration examples

## Authentication Mode Resolution

The application now follows this priority order when determining which client ID to use:

1. **Enhanced Graph Access Enabled** → Uses Microsoft Graph PowerShell client ID (`14d82eec-204b-4c2f-b7e8-296a70dab67e`)
2. **Custom Client ID Provided** → Uses user's custom app registration ID with delegated permissions
3. **Default/Basic Mode** → Uses Microsoft Graph CLI client ID (`04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46`)

## Issue Resolution

The original issue where the app was always using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell client ID (even when Enhanced Graph Access was OFF) has been resolved. The app now:

- Correctly uses the custom client ID when Enhanced Graph Access is OFF and a custom client ID is provided
- Defaults to the Microsoft Graph CLI client ID for Basic User Token mode
- Only uses the Microsoft Graph PowerShell client ID when Enhanced Graph Access is explicitly enabled

## Verification

After these changes:
- ✅ No lint/compilation errors
- ✅ All references to `useApplicationCredentials` and `clientSecret` removed
- ✅ Authentication logic properly handles all three modes
- ✅ UI accurately reflects which authentication mode is active
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect delegated-only support

## Next Steps

The application is now ready for testing to verify:
1. Basic User Token mode works with default Microsoft authentication
2. Custom User Token mode uses the provided custom client ID correctly
3. Enhanced Graph Access mode uses the Microsoft Graph PowerShell client ID
4. The UI correctly shows which mode is active and which client ID is being used

1. **User Token (Standard)**: Uses the application's registered permissions with basic user scope
2. **Enhanced Graph Access**: Uses Microsoft Graph PowerShell client ID for broader delegated permissions

Both modes use delegated permissions and require user authentication. No application tokens or client credentials are used.

## Breaking Changes

### For Users
- Application Credentials toggle has been removed from Settings UI
- Client Secret field has been removed from Settings UI
- Any previously saved Application Credentials configuration will be ignored

### For Developers
- `EntraConfig.clientSecret` property no longer exists
- `EntraConfig.useApplicationCredentials` property no longer exists
- Tests that relied on Application Credentials mode have been deprecated

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users
No action required. The application will automatically use delegated permissions regardless of previous configuration. Any previously configured Application Credentials settings will be ignored.

### For Developers
- Update any code that references `EntraConfig.clientSecret` or `EntraConfig.useApplicationCredentials`
- Remove or refactor tests that depend on Application Credentials mode
- Update documentation to reflect delegated-only authentication

## Future Work

1. **Test Refactoring**: The deprecated test files should be refactored to test Enhanced Graph Access functionality
2. **Backend Cleanup**: Review backend authentication logic to remove any remaining references to Application Credentials mode
3. **Configuration Migration**: Consider adding logic to migrate old configurations that may have Application Credentials settings

## Verification

All code changes compile without errors and the UI correctly shows only the supported authentication modes:
- Settings dialog displays User Token section with Enhanced Graph Access toggle
- No Client Secret field or Application Credentials options are visible
- Test connection properly identifies the authentication mode being tested
- Type definitions enforce delegated-only configuration structure

## Summary

This change successfully removes the misleading Application Credentials mode from EntraPulse Lite, ensuring that the application truly implements delegated-only authentication as originally intended. The UI now accurately reflects the security model, and the codebase is cleaner and more secure.

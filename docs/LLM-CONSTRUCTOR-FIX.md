# LLM Constructor Fix - Cloud Service Initialization

## Problem Description - December 18, 2025

After login, EntraPulse Lite UI showed "No LLM service is currently available" even though cloud providers were properly configured. The specific issue was:

1. Configuration: `provider: 'ollama'`, `preferLocal: true`
2. Ollama not running: `ollama is not running at http://localhost:11434`
3. Azure OpenAI properly configured with API key and base URL
4. Console logs showed: `[UnifiedLLMService] No services are available`

## Root Cause - Constructor Initialization Logic

The `UnifiedLLMService` constructor had flawed initialization logic:

### Before Fix
```typescript
// Only initialized local service when provider was 'ollama'
if (config.provider === 'ollama' || config.provider === 'lmstudio') {
  this.localService = new LLMService(config);
  // Cloud service was NEVER initialized
} else if (config.provider === 'openai' || ...) {
  // Only ran for cloud providers
  this.cloudService = new CloudLLMService(...);
}
```

**Problem**: When `provider: 'ollama'`, only the local service was initialized. Cloud services were completely ignored, even when `cloudProviders` were available in the configuration.

**Result**: The fallback logic in `isAvailable()` had no cloud service to fall back to, always returning `false`.

## Solution - Always Initialize Available Services

### After Fix
```typescript
// Initialize local service if specified
if (config.provider === 'ollama' || config.provider === 'lmstudio') {
  if (config.baseUrl) {
    this.localService = new LLMService(config);
  }
}

// ALWAYS initialize cloud service if cloud providers are available
if (config.cloudProviders && Object.keys(config.cloudProviders).length > 0) {
  let cloudProviderConfig = this.findBestAvailableCloudProvider(config);
  if (cloudProviderConfig) {
    this.cloudService = new CloudLLMService(cloudProviderConfig, this.mcpClient);
  }
}
```

**Key Change**: Cloud services are now initialized regardless of the main provider, as long as cloud providers are available in the configuration.

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### During Initialization
```
[UnifiedLLMService] Constructor called with provider: ollama
[UnifiedLLMService] Initializing local service: ollama
[UnifiedLLMService] Cloud providers are available, attempting to initialize cloud service...
[UnifiedLLMService] Found available cloud provider: azure-openai
[UnifiedLLMService] Initializing CloudLLMService with config: { provider: 'azure-openai', ... }
[UnifiedLLMService] Initialization complete: { hasLocalService: true, hasCloudService: true, preferLocal: true }
```

### During Availability Check
```
[UnifiedLLMService] Checking local service availability...
ollama is not running at http://localhost:11434
[UnifiedLLMService] Local service not available, checking cloud fallback...
[UnifiedLLMService] Checking cloud service availability...
Testing Azure OpenAI connectivity...
[UnifiedLLMService] Cloud service is available
```

### Result
- UI immediately enables chat functionality after login
- No manual settings change required
- Seamless fallback from unavailable local service to available cloud service

## Files Modified

1. **`src/llm/UnifiedLLMService.ts`** - Constructor logic updated to always initialize cloud services when available

## Testing

1. Ensure Ollama is not running
2. Ensure Azure OpenAI is configured with valid API key
3. Configuration has `provider: 'ollama'`, `preferLocal: true`
4. Login to application
5. Expected: Chat is immediately available, no "No LLM service" error

## Impact

- **Immediate**: Fixes the login-to-chat flow without manual intervention
- **Architecture**: Enables true hybrid local/cloud deployments
- **User Experience**: Seamless service fallback
- **Reliability**: More resilient to individual service failures

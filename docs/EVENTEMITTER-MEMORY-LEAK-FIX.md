# EventEmitter Memory Leak Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The application was showing EventEmitter memory leak warnings in the console:
```
⚠ MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 auth:configurationAvailable listeners added.
⚠ MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected. 11 llm:forceStatusRefresh listeners added.
```

This was occurring because multiple components were adding IPC event listeners without properly cleaning them up, causing an accumulation of listeners over time.

## Root Causes
1. **Multiple service instantiations**: The `EnhancedLLMService` was being recreated without disposing of previous instances
2. **React component re-renders**: Components were adding event listeners on every render without proper cleanup
3. **Service reinitialization**: When services were reinitialized (e.g., after configuration changes), old listeners weren't being removed
4. **No centralized event management**: Event listeners were managed individually by each component

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced LLM Service Disposal
- Added `dispose()` method to `EnhancedLLMService` to clean up resources
- Added `isDisposed` flag to prevent usage after disposal
- Enhanced chat method checks for disposal state
- Added conversation context cleanup

**Files Modified:**
- `src/llm/EnhancedLLMService.ts`: Added disposal methods and disposal checking

### 2. Main Process Cleanup
- Enhanced app quit process to properly dispose of LLM service
- Added disposal when services are reinitialized
- Improved service lifecycle management

**Files Modified:**
- `src/main/main.ts`: Added LLM service disposal in cleanup and reinitialization

### 3. Improved Preload Event Management
- Enhanced `on` method to remove existing listeners before adding new ones
- Dynamic adjustment of max listeners based on current count
- Added diagnostic capabilities to monitor listener counts

**Files Modified:**
- `src/preload.js`: Improved event listener management and diagnostics

### 4. Centralized Event Manager
- Created `EventManager` singleton for centralized event listener management
- Component-based tracking to prevent duplicate listeners
- Automatic cleanup of old listeners (older than 1 hour)
- Diagnostic capabilities for monitoring

**Files Added:**
- `src/shared/EventManager.ts`: Centralized event management system

### 5. React Component Event Management
- Updated `App.tsx` and `ChatComponent.tsx` to use EventManager
- Proper cleanup in useEffect cleanup functions
- Component-specific listener tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/App.tsx`: EventManager integration
- `src/renderer/components/ChatComponent.tsx`: EventManager integration

### 6. Periodic Cleanup Hook
- Created `useEventCleanup` hook for periodic maintenance
- Runs cleanup every 30 minutes to prevent accumulation
- Integrated into main App component

**Files Added:**
- `src/renderer/hooks/useEventCleanup.ts`: Periodic cleanup hook

### 7. Development Diagnostics
- Added event listener diagnostic tools for development
- Console utilities to monitor listener counts
- EventManager diagnostic reporting

**Files Added:**
- `src/renderer/utils/eventDiagnostics.ts`: Development diagnostic tools

## Key Features of the Solution

### EventManager Benefits
- **Centralized Management**: All event listeners managed through single point
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically removes existing listeners before adding new ones
- **Component Tracking**: Tracks which component added which listeners
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes old listeners to prevent accumulation
- **Diagnostic Reporting**: Provides insights into current listener state

### Disposal Pattern
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of services and their resources
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Prevents accumulation of unused service instances
- **Lifecycle Management**: Clear service lifecycle with proper cleanup

### Development Tools
- **Console Diagnostics**: `window.__eventDiagnostics()` for real-time monitoring
- **Listener Counting**: Track listener counts per channel
- **Component Mapping**: See which components have active listeners

## Usage Examples

### EventManager Usage
```typescript
// Add listener with component tracking
eventManager.addEventListener(
  'auth:configurationAvailable',
  handleConfigurationAvailable,
  'App.tsx-config',
  electronAPI
);

// Remove specific component's listeners
eventManager.removeEventListener('auth:configurationAvailable', 'App.tsx-config', electronAPI);

// Get diagnostic information
const diagnostics = eventManager.getDiagnostics();
console.log('Current listeners:', diagnostics);
```

### Service Disposal
```typescript
// Dispose of service when no longer needed
if (this.llmService && typeof this.llmService.dispose === 'function') {
  this.llmService.dispose();
}
```

### Development Monitoring
```javascript
// In browser console (development only)
window.__eventDiagnostics(); // Shows current listener state
```

## Performance Impact
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Prevents accumulation of unused listeners
- **Better Performance**: Fewer active listeners means faster event processing
- **Improved Stability**: Prevents memory leaks that could cause application instability

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing code continues to work without modification
- EventManager is opt-in for new components
- Existing event listener patterns still supported

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Periodic cleanup runs automatically every 30 minutes
- Development diagnostics available for troubleshooting
- Clear error messages and warnings for debugging

The implementation successfully resolves the EventEmitter memory leak warnings while providing a robust foundation for event management going forward.

## Error Handling Examples

### `error-handling-example.js`
Demonstrates graceful error handling patterns for missing API keys and service failures in the UnifiedLLMService. This example shows how the application should handle:

- Missing API key configuration
- Service initialization failures  
- Graceful degradation when cloud services are unavailable
- User-friendly error messages instead of crashes

## Usage

These examples are for reference and learning purposes. They demonstrate best practices and patterns used throughout the EntraPulse Lite application.

```javascript
// Example: Running the error handling example
node docs/examples/error-handling-example.js
```

## Contributing
